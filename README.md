# Packagist WebBundle Subtree Split

This is a subtree split of [composer/packagist](https://github.com/composer/packagist)
to contain the `Packagist\WebBundle`.

Currently https://github.com/derhasi/packagist is used to build the subtree
split, as it contains the associated composer.json as the [PR](https://github.com/composer/packagist/pull/478)
is currently open.

The subtree split is created via
[Travis CI 
  ![status](https://api.travis-ci.org/derhasi/packagist-webbundle.svg)
](https://travis-ci.org/derhasi/packagist-webbundle).
